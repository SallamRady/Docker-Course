## Docker FIle
*   docker file is file include commands and instructions which docker use to create image from your project.
### How we could generate Docker File to Generate a docker Image?
*   Firistly, create new file called [Dockerfile] name must be `Dockerfile `
*   Start write commands on `Dockerfile` from commands we may use
<br/>`From   [Base OS]` Base OS it's OS which image will run on it.
<br/>`CMD[command,param1,param2,...]` example `CMD['echo','My Name Sallam Rady']`

### Example for Custom Image

`
FROM alpine
CMD [ "echo","Hello Sallam,I am Your First Custom Image." ]
`
<br/>
=>Know Dockerfile is ready Now, we will build Dockerfile to generate docker image using this command
<br/>
<code>docker build .</code>
<br/>
run this command on project directory where you set `Dockerfile`
<br/>
<br/>
After that Image will be generated with name `<none>` to change name use Tag like this
<br/>
`docker build --tag [tag image name] [path to Dockerfile]`
<br/>
Example :: `docker build --tag hellow-sallam .`
